During my time at Newport News Shipbuilding, I worked as part of E81 Nuclear Propulsion Overhaul team. My work focussed on the safe collection and transportation of nuclear waste including researching packaging methods and material testing. This experience gave me a better understanding of the importance of safety and effective collaboration on large-scale projects.
