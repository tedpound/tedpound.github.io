At InfraVis, I worked on a rail-side sensor system designed to measure the temperature profile of train bearings. I contributed to mechanical design work focused on manufacturing constraints and operation in harsh outdoor environments. This required accounting for rain, snow, heat, and vibration from passing trains that could interfere with sensor accuracy. Through this work, I gained experience designing hardware for reliability under real operating conditions rather than controlled lab settings.

One project I worked on involved designing an air nozzle to remove rainwater from the protective sensor window so that water did not block measurements. I studied airflow behavior and iterated through multiple design concepts before arriving at a solution that met performance requirements. I also designed a long-duration test setup to evaluate system durability, which included programming a microcontroller to actuate components and log measurements over extended periods. This work strengthened my skills in iterative design, experimental testing, and integrating mechanical and embedded systems.
