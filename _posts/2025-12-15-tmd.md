This project involved the design, construction, and testing of a tunable mass damper to reduce vibration in a mechanical system. I developed the mechanical layout, selected components, and built a physical assembly that allowed system stiffness to be adjusted during operation. Analytical models were used to guide design decisions, and system performance was evaluated through controlled vibration testing. The project required close integration of modeling, hardware design, and experimental validation.

    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A key challenge was managing non-ideal behavior in the physical system. Friction, assembly tolerances, and sensor noise caused deviations from predicted response. I addressed these issues by iterating on the mechanical design, revising modeling assumptions, and refining data analysis rather than forcing agreement with ideal results. This work strengthened my ability to evaluate dynamic systems using experimental data and reinforced the importance of designing for adjustability and validation in real engineering applications.
