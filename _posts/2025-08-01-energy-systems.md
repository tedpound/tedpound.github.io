This project involved modeling the energy use of an indoor ice rink by analyzing dehumidification, ice slab heat transfer, and refrigeration as a coupled system. I developed a steady-state model to estimate cooling loads, power consumption, and operating cost for a rink operating under typical conditions in Georgia. The model used standard rink geometry, material properties, and operating assumptions to produce realistic estimates relevant to commercial facilities.

A key challenge was balancing model simplicity with physical accuracy. I made simplifying assumptions to keep the system tractable, then tested sensitivity to parameters such as pipe spacing, ambient conditions, and rink size. In several cases, the model produced non-physical trends outside normal design ranges, which required careful interpretation rather than direct acceptance. This project strengthened my ability to evaluate energy systems at a system level, understand the limits of analytical models, and use quantitative results to guide practical engineering decisions.
