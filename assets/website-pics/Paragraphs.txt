TMD:
	This project involved the design, construction, and testing of a tunable mass damper to reduce vibration in a mechanical system. I developed the mechanical layout, selected components, and built a physical assembly that allowed system stiffness to be adjusted during operation. Analytical models were used to guide design decisions, and system performance was evaluated through controlled vibration testing. The project required close integration of modeling, hardware design, and experimental validation.

	A key challenge was managing non-ideal behavior in the physical system. Friction, assembly tolerances, and sensor noise caused deviations from predicted response. I addressed these issues by iterating on the mechanical design, revising modeling assumptions, and refining data analysis rather than forcing agreement with ideal results. This work strengthened my ability to evaluate dynamic systems using experimental data and reinforced the importance of designing for adjustability and validation in real engineering applications.

Energy Systems:
	As part of my coursework, I was on a team that chose to model the energy use of an indoor ice rink by analyzing dehumidification, ice slab heat transfer, and refrigeration as a coupled system. Our aim was to estimate cooling loads, power consumption, and operating cost for a rink operating under typical conditions in Georgia. The model used standard rink geometry, material properties, and operating assumptions to produce realistic estimates relevant to commercial facilities.
	As part of this team, I developed the heat transfer model of the ice slab to quantify the cooling load experienced by the refrigeration system. A key challenge was making simplifying assumptions to make the system tractable while being realistic. I tested sensitivity to parameters such as pipe spacing, material properties, ambient conditions, and rink size. In several cases, the model produced non-physical trends that required careful interpretation. This project strengthened my ability to evaluate energy systems, understand the limits of analytical models, and use quantitative results to guide practical engineering decisions.

Bike Model:
	This project focused on modeling and analyzing the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a nonlinear state-space framework. I developed a kinematic model with steering angle and longitudinal acceleration as control inputs and vehicle position, velocity, and heading as system states. The model captured nonlinear behavior through trigonometric relationships and velocity-dependent terms commonly used in mobile robot and autonomous vehicle modeling. I then derived a linearized version of the system to evaluate local behavior around an operating point and assess suitability for control design.
	A key challenge was understanding the limits of linearization for control applications. The linear model provided accurate predictions near equilibrium but diverged as inputs increased or operating conditions changed. I compared nonlinear and linear responses through time-domain simulation in MATLAB and analyzed how modeling assumptions affected tracking and stability. This project strengthened my understanding of state-space modeling, linearization, and the tradeoffs involved when applying control techniques to nonlinear robotic systems.

NNS:
	During my time at Newport News Shipbuilding, I worked as part of E81 Nuclear Propulsion Overhaul team. My work focussed on the safe collection and transportation of nuclear waste including researching packaging methods and material testing. This experience gave me a better understanding of the importance of safety and effective collaboration on large-scale projects.


Infravis:
	At InfraVis, I worked on a rail-side sensor system designed to measure the temperature profile of train bearings. I contributed to mechanical design work focused on manufacturing constraints and operation in harsh outdoor environments. This required accounting for rain, snow, heat, and vibration from passing trains that could interfere with sensor accuracy. Through this work, I gained experience designing hardware for reliability under real operating conditions rather than controlled lab settings.
	One project I worked on involved designing an air nozzle to remove rainwater from the protective sensor window so that water did not block measurements. I studied airflow behavior and iterated through multiple design concepts before arriving at a solution that met performance requirements. I also designed a long-duration test setup to evaluate system durability, which included programming a microcontroller to actuate components and log measurements over extended periods. This work strengthened my skills in iterative design, experimental testing, and integrating mechanical and embedded systems.

ME2110:
	This project involved the design and fabrication of a competition robot under strict size, cost, and reliability constraints. My primary contribution focused on CAD development of the full mechanical system, including the base structure, drawer slide assemblies, grabbing arms, and winch integration. I created detailed assemblies to ensure components fit within the required envelope, aligned correctly during motion, and could be fabricated using available materials and hardware. The CAD models were used throughout the project to guide design decisions and support fabrication.
