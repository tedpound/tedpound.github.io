TMD:
	This project involved the design, construction, and testing of a tunable mass damper to reduce vibration in a mechanical system. I developed the mechanical layout, selected components, and built a physical assembly that allowed system stiffness to be adjusted during operation. Analytical models were used to guide design decisions, and system performance was evaluated through controlled vibration testing. The project required close integration of modeling, hardware design, and experimental validation.

	A key challenge was managing non-ideal behavior in the physical system. Friction, assembly tolerances, and sensor noise caused deviations from predicted response. I addressed these issues by iterating on the mechanical design, revising modeling assumptions, and refining data analysis rather than forcing agreement with ideal results. This work strengthened my ability to evaluate dynamic systems using experimental data and reinforced the importance of designing for adjustability and validation in real engineering applications.

Energy Systems:
	This project involved modeling the energy use of an indoor ice rink by analyzing dehumidification, ice slab heat transfer, and refrigeration as a coupled system. I developed a steady-state model to estimate cooling loads, power consumption, and operating cost for a rink operating under typical conditions in Georgia. The model used standard rink geometry, material properties, and operating assumptions to produce realistic estimates relevant to commercial facilities.
	A key challenge was balancing model simplicity with physical accuracy. I made simplifying assumptions to keep the system tractable, then tested sensitivity to parameters such as pipe spacing, ambient conditions, and rink size. In several cases, the model produced non-physical trends outside normal design ranges, which required careful interpretation rather than direct acceptance. This project strengthened my ability to evaluate energy systems at a system level, understand the limits of analytical models, and use quantitative results to guide practical engineering decisions.

Bike Model:
	This project focused on modeling and analyzing the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a nonlinear state-space framework. I developed a kinematic model with steering angle and longitudinal acceleration as control inputs and vehicle position, velocity, and heading as system states. The model captured nonlinear behavior through trigonometric relationships and velocity-dependent terms commonly used in mobile robot and autonomous vehicle modeling. I then derived a linearized version of the system to evaluate local behavior around an operating point and assess suitability for control design.
	A key challenge was understanding the limits of linearization for control applications. The linear model provided accurate predictions near equilibrium but diverged as inputs increased or operating conditions changed. I compared nonlinear and linear responses through time-domain simulation in MATLAB and analyzed how modeling assumptions affected tracking and stability. This project strengthened my understanding of state-space modeling, linearization, and the tradeoffs involved when applying control techniques to nonlinear robotic systems.

NNS:
	During my time at Newport News Shipbuilding, I worked as part of E81 Nuclear Propulsion Overhaul team. My work focussed on the safe collection and transportation of nuclear waste including researching packaging methods and material testing. This experience gave me a better understanding of the importance of safety and effective collaboration on large-scale projects.
